summary: "Let's crack the code on how to do proper exit and enter animations on page transitions in Next.js App Router using Framer Motion."

At the time of writing, Next.js does not have built-in support for page transitions. This is a feature that many developers have been asking for, and there are a few libraries out there that can help you achieve this. One of the most popular libraries for adding page transitions to Next.js is Framer Motion.

However, getting Framer Motion to work with Next.js App Router can be a bit tricky, especially if you want to add exit animations to your pages. An issue arises when the Next.js app router causes components to unmount and remount abruptly, disrupting animations. Here's how we can tackle this problem.

The versions used at the time of writing are as follows:

- Next.js: 14.2.3
- Framer Motion: 11.2.10

### Setting up Framer Motion

The first thing you need to do is install Framer Motion in your Next.js project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bun add framer-motion
```

_(Yes  -  I think bun is the best. If you are using npm, you can run `npm install framer-motion` instead.)_

### Creating the `LayoutTransition` component

Next, let's create a new component called `LayoutTransition` that will handle the page transitions for us:

```typescript title="components/layout-transition.tsx"
"use client";
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from "framer-motion";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

interface LayoutTransitionProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: React.ComponentProps<typeof motion.div>["className"];
  style?: React.ComponentProps<typeof motion.div>["style"];
  initial: React.ComponentProps<typeof motion.div>["initial"];
  animate: React.ComponentProps<typeof motion.div>["animate"];
  exit: React.ComponentProps<typeof motion.div>["exit"];
}

export function LayoutTransition({
  children,
  className,
  style,
  initial,
  animate,
  exit,
}: LayoutTransitionProps) {
  const path = usePathname();

  return (
    <AnimatePresence mode="wait" initial={false}>
      <motion.div
        className={className}
        style={style}
        key={path}
        initial={initial}
        animate={animate}
        exit={exit}
      >
        {children}
      </motion.div>
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
}
```

In this component, we are using the `AnimatePresence` component from Framer Motion to handle the page transitions. We are also using the `motion.div` component to create a container for our page content. The `key` prop is set to the current path, which will trigger the exit animation when the pathname changes.

### Using the `LayoutTransition` component

Now that we have our `LayoutTransition` component, we can use it in our layout components to add page transitions to our Next.js app. Here is an example of how you can use the `LayoutTransition` component in your layout:

```typescript title="app/layout.tsx" {11-17}
import { LayoutTransition } from "@/components/layout-transition";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <LayoutTransition
          initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
          exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
        >
          {children}
        </LayoutTransition>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

We are getting there! However, this doesn't really work as intended. Even though we do in fact see an exit animation, it manages to load the next page first, and then animate the exit transition followed by the enter transition. This is not what we want.

## The Core Issue with Next.js App Router and Framer Motion

The primary challenge with using Framer Motion in a Next.js app lies in the router's handling of component lifecycles. The Next.js app router updates the context frequently during navigation, causing components to unmount and remount abruptly. This disrupts the smooth flow of animations provided by Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components. The sudden unmounting interrupts ongoing animations, leading to jarring transitions and a suboptimal user experience.

### Investigating the Problem

1. **Router Context Changes:** The router context updates with each navigation action, leading to new instances of components.
2. **Component Lifecycle Interruption:** These frequent updates force components to unmount and remount, which is detrimental to animations that rely on the stability of the component tree.

### Proposed Solution

To mitigate this, we devise a two-part solution: `FrozenRouter` and `LayoutTransition`.

### Step 1: Custom Hook - `usePreviousValue`

We create a custom hook, `usePreviousValue`, to retain the previous value of a variable. This hook utilizes a `ref` to store the previous value, updating it during each render and resetting it when the component unmounts.

```typescript title="components/layout-transition.tsx"
function usePreviousValue<T>(value: T): T | undefined {
  const prevValue = useRef<T>();

  useEffect(() => {
    prevValue.current = value;
    return () => {
      prevValue.current = undefined;
    };
  });

  return prevValue.current;
}
```

### Step 2: `FrozenRouter` Component

The `FrozenRouter` component uses `useContext` to access the current router context and `usePreviousValue` to track the previous context and layout segment. It then compares the current and previous segments to decide if the context should change. This approach ensures the context only updates when necessary, preventing unnecessary unmounting and remounting of components.

```typescript title="components/layout-transition.tsx"
function FrozenRouter(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const context = useContext(LayoutRouterContext);
  const prevContext = usePreviousValue(context) || null;

  const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment();
  const prevSegment = usePreviousValue(segment);

  const changed = segment !== prevSegment && segment !== undefined && prevSegment !== undefined;

  return (
    <LayoutRouterContext.Provider value={changed ? prevContext : context}>
      {props.children}
    </LayoutRouterContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Wait - hold your horses! Here we are using `LayoutRouterContext` and `useSelectedLayoutSegment` - what are these?

#### What is `LayoutRouterContext`?

`LayoutRouterContext` is a context object provided by Next.js, which contains the current layout state of the router. This context helps in managing and propagating layout state changes throughout the application.

#### How We Use `LayoutRouterContext`

1.  **Importing the Context:**
    We import `LayoutRouterContext` from Next.js and use it within our components.

    ```typescript
    import { LayoutRouterContext } from "next/dist/shared/lib/app-router-context.shared-runtime";
    ```

2.  **Using it in `FrozenRouter`:**
    In the `FrozenRouter` component, we access the current context and track the previous context using the `usePreviousValue` hook. This helps us determine whether the context has changed due to navigation.

        - **Context Access:** We use `useContext(LayoutRouterContext)` to get the current router context.

        - **Previous Context Tracking:** The `usePreviousValue` hook helps in storing the previous context value.

        - **Context Decision:** We determine if the context should be updated based on whether the segment has changed. If it has, we provide the previous context to preserve the current state, thus not unmounting the currently shown route.

This approach prevents the disruption of Framer Motion animations during route changes, ensuring a seamless user experience. By controlling the context updates, we mitigate the issues caused by the Next.js app router's handling of component lifecycles.

#### What is `useSelectedLayoutSegment`?

`useSelectedLayoutSegment` is a Next.js navigation hook that retrieves the current layout segment from the router context. This hook helps in determining the layout segment for the current route, allowing us to compare it with the previous segment to decide if the context should be updated.

```typescript
import { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from "next/navigation";
```

#### Why do we use `useSelectedLayoutSegment`?

We used `usePathname` to get the current path, and set the respective key in the `LayoutTransition` component. However, what if we wanted to use this animation component in other layout files?

By using `useSelectedLayoutSegment`, we can get the current layout segment from the router context, and by comparing the current state and previous state, we can decide whether to perform the animation or not.

Say you have a layout on root level and another layout in your `/posts` directory. When we use `useSelectedLayoutSegment`, we can wrap the `LayoutTransition` component around the children in the posts layout, which will then be the only place where the animation will be performed when the user navigates within the `/posts` route segment.

### Step 3: `LayoutTransition` Component

`LayoutTransition` wraps its children in Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` and `motion.div` components for animations. By using `FrozenRouter`, it ensures the context remains stable during animations, preventing the disruption of animations due to component unmounting and remounting.

```typescript title="components/layout-transition.tsx" {9,21-23}
export function LayoutTransition({
  children,
  className,
  style,
  initial,
  animate,
  exit,
}: LayoutTransitionProps) {
  const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment();

  return (
    <AnimatePresence mode="wait" initial={false}>
      <motion.div
        className={className}
        style={style}
        key={segment}
        initial={initial}
        animate={animate}
        exit={exit}
      >
        <FrozenRouter>
          {children}
        </FrozenRouter>
      </motion.div>
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
}
```

Notice how we are now using `useSelectedLayoutSegment` instead of `usePathname` to get the current layout segment, and setting it as the key for the `motion.div` component.

Here is the complete code for the `layout-transition.tsx` file:

```typescript title="components/layout-transition.tsx"
"use client";

import { AnimatePresence, motion } from "framer-motion";
import { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from "next/navigation";
import { LayoutRouterContext } from "next/dist/shared/lib/app-router-context.shared-runtime";

import { useContext, useEffect, useRef } from "react";

function usePreviousValue<T>(value: T): T | undefined {
  const prevValue = useRef<T>();

  useEffect(() => {
    prevValue.current = value;
    return () => {
      prevValue.current = undefined;
    };
  });

  return prevValue.current;
}

function FrozenRouter(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const context = useContext(LayoutRouterContext);
  const prevContext = usePreviousValue(context) || null;

  const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment();
  const prevSegment = usePreviousValue(segment);

  const changed =
    segment !== prevSegment &&
    segment !== undefined &&
    prevSegment !== undefined;

  return (
    <LayoutRouterContext.Provider value={changed ? prevContext : context}>
      {props.children}
    </LayoutRouterContext.Provider>
  );
}

interface LayoutTransitionProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: React.ComponentProps<typeof motion.div>["className"];
  style?: React.ComponentProps<typeof motion.div>["style"];
  initial: React.ComponentProps<typeof motion.div>["initial"];
  animate: React.ComponentProps<typeof motion.div>["animate"];
  exit: React.ComponentProps<typeof motion.div>["exit"];
}

export function LayoutTransition({
  children,
  className,
  style,
  initial,
  animate,
  exit,
}: LayoutTransitionProps) {
  const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment();

  return (
    <AnimatePresence mode="wait" initial={false}>
      <motion.div
        className={className}
        style={style}
        key={segment}
        initial={initial}
        animate={animate}
        exit={exit}
      >
        <FrozenRouter>{children}</FrozenRouter>
      </motion.div>
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
}
```
